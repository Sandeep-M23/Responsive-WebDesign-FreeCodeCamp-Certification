        <b>FC Barcelona - </b></br>
        Barça is a club with a long tradition and a chequered history
        The FC Barcelona is a club with many superlatives: with approximately 162,000 members it is the second largest sports club in the world. With Camp Nou it owns the largest football stadium in Europe and no other European football club has more fan communities. In 2016/17, the team made a profit of 18 million € on a turnover of 535 million €.

        For the Catalans, the FC Barcelona is one of the most important icons of the Catalan national pride. It is also a symbol of resistance against the suppression they had to experience, especially by the Franco regime.

        With these facts in mind, and true to the club’s motto "More than a club", we now want to tell you the about the history and backgrounds of the FC Barcelona.
      </p>

        <b>The FC Barcelona - more than 100 years of history - </b></br>
        Tickets for games of FC Barcelona
        A home game of FC Barcelona at Camp Nou, Europe's largest stadium, is a special experience.

        Since its foundation in 1899, the FC Barcelona has experienced many ups and downs: Sporting successes like winning the Champions League and five cups in one year are just two of the many highlights. On the other hand, the club’s president Josep Suñol being murdered by Franco’s soldiers was one of many downs in the history of the traditional club.

      <b>The stadium Camp Nou - </b></br>
      The number of members of the FC Barcelona and of their fans kept rising in the 1950s so that soon a new, larger stadium was needed. On September 24, 1957, the new stadium Camp Nou with a capacity for 90 000 spectators was inaugurated after three years of construction. During the first three years in the new stadium, the team was rather unsuccessful, but the number of members never stopped growing. One of the biggest attractions of following Barça was its increasing symbolism of Catalan identity.

      About the Camp Nou
      Camp Nou, the stadium of FC Barcelona, is the largest in Europe. And it is aggravated further.

      The construction of the new stadium was overshadowed by the club’s financial troubles. The estimated construction costs of approx. 66.6 million pesetas were exceeded by 221.4 million pesetas. Mortgages and short-term credits had to be raised. Further help came from the penyes, the fan communities, which is why today they have quite a say when it comes to club matters.

      In 2003, the English architect Norman Foster was assigned to extend the stadium’s capacity by another 30 000 seats.

      <b>The FC Barcelona´s club motto: "Més que un club" (More than a club) - </b><br/>
      It was president Narcís de Carreras who proclaimed the slogan "Barça, més que un club" in his presidential acceptance speech in January of 1968 that is still today the motto of the club.
      Barça was more than just a sports club, despite or maybe because of the restrictions and despotism the club had to suffer during the Franco regime. It turned into a symbol of the Catalan striving for independence and the opposition against the Franco regime. With this symbol, Carreras showed the solidarity between the club and his Catalan fans.
      The FC Barcelona was very popular in these days and the number of new members increased enormously, thus the club gained political influence in Barcelona. This way, a new president could be appointed who was not a Franco-devoted official. Free elections could not be held at this time.

      President Agustí Montal i Costa (1969–1977), Carrera’s successor, kept on leading the club with the new motto. He fought against the restrictions that Franco’s sport authority had enforced upon the club and for democracy within the athletic unions and clubs. He thus went on a straight collision course with the sport authority.

      <b>The decade of the Dutchman Johann Cryuff and the "dream team"(1976-1996) - </b></br>
      After severe discussions with the sport authority, a new player, the Dutchman Johann Cruyff, joined the team in 1973. The authority had established random regulations on the status of foreign players with Spanish parents.

      Still, Cruyff played his first match on October 28, 1973. He quickly won the hearts of the Catalan fans having chosen Barça over Real Madrid and a Catalan name for his son Jordi (the name of the patron saint of Catalonia). He helped the club win on several occasions and soon became one of the most important personalities in the history of the Barça.

      1974, in the year of its 75th anniversary, with Cryuff´s help the FC Barcelona won the Spanish championship and – probably even more important – defeated Read Madrid 5-0 at their Bernabéu stadium.

      Three years after Franco’s death, democracy was introduced to the FC Barcelona just as Agusti Montal had demanded: In 1978, Josep Lluís Núñez was elected president of the FC Barcelona in the first open elections with the members of the club voting. It was a tight victory over two other candidates, and Josep Lluís Núñez remained in office until 2000, being the longest-serving president in the entire history of the club.

      In the late 1980s, the FC Barcelona once again was unsuccessful. It came to a rebellion of the players against president Núñez known as the Motín de Hesperia (Hesperia Mutiny) in which the team demanded the board’s resignation. The situation changed when in 1988 Johan Cryuff returned to the FC Barcelona as trainer. He started introducing new playing methods and reassembled the team. Under Cryuff’s guidance, the FC Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994 and for the first time the European Cup in 1992.

      The sporting success of the team in its present constellation was so great that it went down in the history of the FC Barcelona as the “Dream Team”. In 1994 the era of the “Dream Team” ended with the defeat in the UEFA Champions League final in Athens.

      By the time the World Cup of 1992 took place, the capacity of the stadium was enlarged and the Miniestadi (small stadium) was built next to it for the second team.

      <b>Barca’s most successful time under coach Josep Guardiola - </b><br/>
      The four years under coach Josep Gardiola are considered the most successful period in FC Barcelona’s history. Gardiola – who himself played on the FC Barcelona "Dream Team" under Cryuff - coached the club from 2008 to 2012. During this time, Barca won 14 titles: these include Spanish championships (2009, 2010, 2011), Champions League victories (2009, 2011), Spanish Cups (2009, 2012), Spanish Super Cup (2009, 2010, 2011).

     <b> The FC Barcelona Foundation - </b><br/>
     Football is a global phenomenon. The number of fans of the FC Barcelona not only grows in Catalonia, Spain and Europe but everywhere in the world. There are officially registered FC Barcelona fan clubs all over the globe. The FC Barcelona, which also sees itself as a defender of justice and freedom, wants to respond to the enthusiasm of fans all over the world.

     Barça wants to be more than an international club and has set up the non-profit Foundation FC Barcelona in 2006 to which it donates 0,7 per cent of its ordinary income. In collaboration with UNICEF, the club will pursue the UN Millennium Development Goals with its foundation. For five years, the players will have the UNICEF logo on their shirts instead of a sponsor’s logo.

     <b> The symbols of the FC Barcelona</b><br/>
     The club emblem
     Since their first match, the players of the FC Barcelona had an emblem on their shirts. The original one was the coat of arms of Barcelona surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and one of a palm tree, and a bat and a crown on top of it.
     In 1910, a new emblem was introduced after a competition. It is still in use today but over the time faced some modernizations - the last one in 2002 when the shape were made simpler.
     The most significant changes came about during the Franco regime: the letters FCB were replaced by CFB to reflect the way the club was forced to use the Spanish version of its name. The dictatorship also obliged the club to remove two of the four red bars. On occasion of the club´s 75th anniversary, the four bars returned. In 1947, the emblem reverted to its original design of 1910.
   </p>
   <p><b>Trophy cabinet - </b></br>
    Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 74 trophies: 26 La Liga, 30 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, 3 Copa Eva Duarte, and 2 Copa de la Liga trophies, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 20 European and worldwide titles: 5 UEFA Champions League titles, a record 4 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, a joint record 5 UEFA Super Cup, a record 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and 3 FIFA Club World Cup.[5] Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015[6][7] and currently occupies the third position on the UEFA club rankings.[8] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico.
